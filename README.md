# Purpose

This web application is designed to serve as a live MVG transport tracker for your home or office, similar to the live schedules displayed at bus/tram halts and train stations. The application is designed to accommodate both touch and keyboard inputs.

# Changing Stations

To switch your station click on the screen or press `Ctrl` + `1`, click on the station list and start typing your station's name. Once you select your station the application will reload to display the applicable journeys.

> Reloading the application will not clear the station. In order to reset the application to defaults click on the `Reset` button in the settings screen or press `Ctrl` + `0`.

# Shortcuts

- `Ctrl` + `1` - Open settings
- `Ctrl` + `9` - Settings reload
- `Ctrl` + `0` - Reset app to defaults

# Installation Recommendation

Use an RPi or similar low-powered SoC together with a low-energy e-Ink display as a permanent installation for this tracker.
